FlashIt is a cross-platform desktop application that creates bootable USB drives for Windows, Linux, and other operating systems.

## Features

- **Windows USB Creation** - Create bootable Windows 10/11 installers with automatic WIM splitting for FAT32 compatibility
- **Linux USB Creation** - Create bootable Linux installers for Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, and other distributions
- **Cross-Platform** - Native app for macOS, Windows, and ~~Linux~~ *(coming soon)*

## Platform Support

| Host OS | Windows USB | Linux USB |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| macOS   | Yes         | Yes       |
| Windows | Yes         | Yes       |
| ~~Linux~~   | ~~Yes~~         | ~~Yes~~       |

## Usage

1. **Choose your ISO** - Select the ISO file you want to flash
2. **Select target USB** - Pick the USB drive (only removable drives are shown)
3. **Flash** - Click start and wait for completion

## Safety

FlashIt includes multiple safety mechanisms:

- **Boot drive protection** - Refuses to write to system drives
- **Removable-only filtering** - Only shows removable USB drives as targets
- **Privilege verification** - Uses platform-native elevation (launchd on macOS, UAC on Windows)

## Pure Go WIM Implementation

Creating Windows bootable USBs requires splitting large `install.wim` files to fit within FAT32's 4GB file size limit. Most tools rely on [wimlib](https://wimlib.net/), a C library that can be difficult to build and distribute across platforms.

FlashIt includes a **pure Go implementation** of WIM file reading and splitting. This means:

- **No external dependencies** - Everything is bundled in the app
- **No native libraries** - No need to install wimlib or any other tools
- **Truly cross-platform** - The same code runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux

## Roadmap

- [ ] **Linux Host Support** - Native Linux build of the application
- [ ] **Write Verification** - Verify USB contents after flashing to ensure a successful write
- [ ] **ISO Downloads** - Download popular Linux distributions directly from the app
